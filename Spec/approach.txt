Approach:
	1. Build incrementally
	2. Use robust outline to build, rather than coding features
	3. Utility first, then viral 

Technical Specs:
	- One engine, 2 front ends
	- Continually enhance decision making power/ability of intelligent engine

Order of Implementation:
	1. Actual: Create employees and calculate burn rate + headcount info 
		a. Headcount, non-headcount, HR costs
	2. Drag and drop into months 
	3. Build graphs
	4. Build AI suggestions
	5. Build "what-if"
	6. Enhance design, intelligence, and features 

Tech Stack: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- Recommended Tech Stack: React + Vite + Tailwind CSSComponentChoiceWhy?FrameworkReact (via Vite)The industry standard for "smooth, intuitive" interfaces4. It handles real-time updates (typing = graph moves) instantly.LanguageJavaScript (not TS)Since you know Python, sticking to looser JavaScript will be faster for you than fighting TypeScript errors during a 3-hour rush.StylingTailwind CSSYou don't write CSS files. You just tell Cursor "Make this a red button," and it writes the classes for you.Drag & Drop@dnd-kit/coreA pre-built library. Building drag-and-drop from scratch in 3 hours is impossible.ChartsRechartsSimple, composable charts that look professional 5 and can be easily "themed" for the viral version.AnimationsFramer MotionCritical for the "Viral" version (Death clock, shaking effects)6.
