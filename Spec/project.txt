Headcount Scenario Planner:
Model Y our Startup's Growth
Background
Warp is an engineering-driven company building the future of automated back-
office operations. We're looking for a Growth Engineer who's excited to join our
early story and help us dominate the market through technical growth
experiments.
You'll sit at the critical intersection of engineering, data, and growth strategy—
shipping high-impact technical projects that directly accelerate our mission to
eliminate HR operations overhead for startups forever.
Your Mission
Build TWO versions of a headcount planning tool that helps founders model their
team growth and burn rate—one utility-focused for serious planning, one growth-
hack version that's shareable and viral.
Overview
Every founder struggles with the same spreadsheet: modeling headcount growth
versus cash runway. They copy-paste salary data, manually calculate burn rates,
and email static screenshots to their board. The math is simple but the tools are
terrible.
Competitors like Gusto have calculator suites, but they're generic and boring.
Party Round's "Burn the Runway" showed that financial tools can be fun and viral.
We want both: a serious planning tool that converts users AND a viral version that
spreads organically.
Part 1: Utility Version (Warp-style)
Build a professional headcount planner that founders actually use for board
meetings.

Part 2: Growth Hack Version

Submission
Format: GitHub repo with code + 2 working local apps + design notes
Timeline: 3-5 hours maximum. We respect your time—perfect is the enemy of

stronger at design, make it beautiful. If you're stronger at engineering, make it
bulletproof. Show us what excellence means to you.
